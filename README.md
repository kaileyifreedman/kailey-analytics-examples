# Analytics & Data Code Samples – Kailey Freedman-Setaro

This repository contains representative SQL and Python code samples illustrating my analytics and technical skills. These examples reflect the same tools and workflows I used while:

• Building SQL-based reporting views and Power BI dashboards for 2,000+ Managed Services deals during my C1 internship  
• Developing AI-powered automation tools for HR and finance workflows at Mission Edge  
• Creating LearningYourWay.net, an AI-driven EdTech platform that generates personalized worksheets
